If you've never used an ImageJ Macro script before, here's what you do.

1. Download the file by clicking the green button:  Clone or download > Download ZIP
2. Open FIJI. Click Plugins > Macros > Install... select sequence_videos.ijm
3. From now on, you can run the Macros by clicking Plugins > Macros > sequential_videos. It'll ask you to select the folder of images you want to make the videos from.

* Note that FIJI is a distribution of ImageJ which includes Bioformats. (ImageJ does not come with Bioformats when you download it. But FIJI does).
